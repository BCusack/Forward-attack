## Lectorial 2 - Security in Computing

## Python 3 code to demonstrate

## SHA256 hash algorithms.

# Online bid method discussed in the lecture

Example of SHA256 forward attack using a list of known hashes indexed by position

- Range is the known list of values
- Bob's bid Hash is the hash to be cracked
- Get Bob's Hash or use genrator online https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/
- Paste into the hash checker

Create a list of known hashes in range
